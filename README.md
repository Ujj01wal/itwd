🌐 ITWD Assignment Solutions – Interactive Webpage

This repository contains the complete solutions to 15 problem statements assigned as part of the Internet Technology & Web Development (ITWD) coursework. All solutions are compiled into a single structured webpage to ensure easy navigation, clean design, and interactive learning.

The core objective of this project is to integrate theoretical concepts with practical coding implementations. Every problem has been solved systematically using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, followed by an embedded virtual code runner that allows users to test, execute, and experiment with the code snippets directly on the page. This makes the repository not only a solution bank but also an interactive learning resource.

📌 Key Highlights:
	•	✅ 15 Questions Solved – Covering essential ITWD concepts.
	•	✅ Single Compiled Webpage – Easy navigation with question-wise sections.
	•	✅ Clean UI/UX – Simple yet professional layout suitable for both academic and personal projects.
	•	✅ Live Code Runner Integration – Run and modify code instantly without leaving the site.
	•	✅ Reusable Resource – Can serve as a quick revision guide, a practice tool, or a reference for future projects.

🚀 Tech Stack:
	•	HTML5 for semantic structure.
	•	CSS3 for styling and responsive design.
	•	JavaScript for interactivity and live code execution.

🎯 Purpose:

The aim of this project is not just to complete an assignment, but to showcase how web technologies can be combined to create an engaging and functional educational tool. It also highlights the importance of hands-on coding and the role of interactive platforms in learning modern web development.

🌟 Future Scope:
	•	Adding more problem sets and categories.
	•	Improving UI with advanced CSS frameworks (Tailwind/Bootstrap).
	•	Hosting the project for public access and collaborative learning.
